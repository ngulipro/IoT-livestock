IoT-livestock
Overview

This project provides a smart IoT solution for livestock management to prevent disease outbreaks and reduce losses in animal farming. It leverages IoT sensors, real-time tracking, and data analytics to monitor the health, location, and behavior of livestock, enabling early disease detection and efficient farm management.

By integrating IoT devices, cloud-based data storage, and intelligent alert systems, this system ensures timely intervention and improved decision-making for farmers and livestock managers.

Key Features

Real-Time Health Monitoring: Tracks vital signs such as body temperature, heart rate, and activity level using wearable sensors.

Location Tracking: Uses GPS modules to monitor livestock movement and prevent theft or loss.

Disease Prediction & Alerts: Implements AI/ML models to analyze health patterns and predict potential diseases.

Environmental Monitoring: Monitors ambient conditions (temperature, humidity) in barns to maintain optimal living conditions.

Cloud Integration: Stores health data on a secure cloud platform for remote access and long-term analysis.

Mobile & Web Dashboard: Provides an intuitive interface for farmers to visualize livestock health, receive alerts, and manage data.

Automated Notifications: Sends SMS/Email alerts for abnormal health indicators or disease risks.
